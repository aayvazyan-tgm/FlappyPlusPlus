FlappyPlusPlus
==============

A Android game, inspired by flappy birds, using Andengine

You can download the compiled .apk from the flappy++ folder in the root directory.


Important note: due to a bug/"undocumented future" in andengine i had to rewrite the setText function in Text.java of Andengine GLES2, to hotfix this issue you can just put a try/catch around this class.
